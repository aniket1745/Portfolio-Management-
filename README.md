Created and managed a diversified ₹5,00,000 investment portfolio across equity, mutual funds, ETFs, and digital gold, applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) for optimal risk-return balance. Tracked performance (-9.07%) and analyzed factors driving returns using risk metrics like beta, standard deviation, and correlation. 
Conducted portfolio construction with an initial corpus of ₹5,00,000, allocated across Equity Stocks (80%), Mutual Funds (7%), Digital Gold (6%), and ETFs (7%).
Applied Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) concepts to optimize risk-return balance through asset allocation and diversification.
Performed daily tracking and analysis of portfolio performance, including price movements, sector-wise performance, and market trends.
Calculated and monitored portfolio returns (-9.07%) and identified key factors contributing to underperformance.
Implemented risk management techniques such as standard deviation, beta analysis, and correlation assessment to evaluate asset volatility and diversification efficiency.
Prepared a comprehensive report documenting investment rationale, performance analysis, and future recommendations.
Project Summary:
In this project, I developed and managed a diversified investment portfolio to understand practical applications of security analysis and portfolio management concepts. The project involved allocating ₹5,00,000 across multiple asset classes — equities, mutual funds, digital gold, and ETFs — and actively tracking performance over a defined period. Using tools like risk-return tradeoff, correlation analysis, and rebalancing strategies, I assessed portfolio volatility and returns, ultimately identifying underperformance drivers and potential optimization strategies. The project enhanced my skills in financial analysis, investment decision-making, and risk management, providing a hands-on experience in real-time portfolio monitoring.
